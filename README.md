# hello-world
I have no idea what any of these github terms are, so I'm just following their instructions.

I'm a super amateur at everything, and all I know how to do is basic HTML and CSS. I __also__ know *markdown*, which I use to type my notes in college, but that's not useful on most of the internet, I guess. There are a lot of apps and websites I want to make, so I'm teaching myself how to code/program because I love to suffer. Biology is my major, but I can probably use this in the future. Maybe.
